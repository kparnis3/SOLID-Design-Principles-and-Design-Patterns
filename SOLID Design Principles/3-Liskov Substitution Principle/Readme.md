# Liskov Substitution Principle

We should be able to subsititute base class objects with child class objects & this should not alter behaviour/characteristics of our program

Obj is swapped but we expect the same behaviour.
```
Obj1:Base --> Behaviour
    | 
    v  
Obj2:Derived --> Behaviour 
```
