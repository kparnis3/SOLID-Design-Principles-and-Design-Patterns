Liskov Substitution Principle

We should be able to subsititute base class objects with child class objects & this should not alter behaviour/characteristics of our program

Obj is swapped but we expect the same behaviour. </br>
Obj1:Base --> Behaviour </br>
    | </br>
    v   </br>
Obj2:Derived --> Behaviour
