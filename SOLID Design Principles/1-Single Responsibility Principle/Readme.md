Single Responsibility Principle

- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.</br>
```
Class -> focused, single functionality.
      -> address a specific concern.
```

Examples: addition of parameters, protocol change and message format change.</br>

- If we have three sepreate resposabilities, then we should have three classes addressing those responsabilities.</br>
