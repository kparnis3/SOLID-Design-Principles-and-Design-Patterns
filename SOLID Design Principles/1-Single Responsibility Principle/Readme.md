Single Responsibility Principle

- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
Class -> focused, single functionality.
      -> address a specific concern.

Examples: addition of parameters, protocol change and message format change.

- If we have three sepreate resposabilities, then we should have three classes addressing those responsabilities.
